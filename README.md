Rock Paper Scissors

## About

[The Odin Project][https://www.theodinproject.com/about] assigns Rock Paper Scissors as part of its Javascript Basics course. The project is assigned in two parts. [The first part][https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors] sets the task of coding the game logic in Javascript, with output rendered to console. The earlier commits implement this. [The second part][https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors] sets the task of adding a user interface.

In addition to what was assigned, I set myself additional goals. For Javascript, I tried to separate model, view, and controller functions, and I tried to make sure that my functions do just one thing. For CSS, I implemented flexboxes, used clickable images for the user interface, and kept styling to a minimum. (Minimal coloration, web-safe font, and the images are just snapshots of my hand.)
